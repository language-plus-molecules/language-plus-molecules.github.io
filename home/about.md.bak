Welcome to the Language + Molecules Workshop! Join us as we explore molecular solutions from the chemistry domain, such as developing new drugs (e.g. kinase inhibitors), materials (e.g. organic photovoltaics), and chemical processes. These solutions exist in extremely large search spaces, which makes AI tools a necessity. Excitingly, the chemistry field is posed to be substantially accelerated via multimodal models combining language with molecules and drug structures.

Welcome to the Language + Molecules Workshop! Join us as we explore the integration of molecules and natural language, with exciting applications such as developing new drugs, materials, and chemical processes. These molecular solutions  will be critical to address global problems on scales of complexity never-before-seen, in areas such as climate change and healthcare. However, they exist in extremely large search spaces, which makes AI tools a necessity. Excitingly, the chemistry field is posed to be substantially accelerated via multimodal models combining language with molecules and drug structures.
